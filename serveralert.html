        <h1>Breaking News from Eden</h1>
        <p>
            In the year 115, Empress Thellyn Vala'dyr Thelsaron issued a monumental decree that forever altered the course of Eden's history. By her command, all heads of the noble houses from the old era were to relinquish their power, making way for their heirs to ascend and lead in this new age. This sweeping change marked the dawn of Edenâ€™s first empress, as the divines themselves proclaimed that the Thelsaron bloodline was destined to become the divine lineage of the realm. Thus, the ancient houses bowed before the will of the divines, ushering in an era shaped by the sacred blood of the Thelsarons.
